# Conway's Game of Life
## And other such curios

A Clojure library for running cellular automata simulations!

## Usage

From leiningen, project can be run directly using `lein run` or built into a jar `lein jar` or standalone _uber_-jar `lein uberjar`.

## Conway's Rules

 - Live cells with fewer than 2 neighbors die, as if by loneliness. 
 - Live cells with 2 or 3 neighbors propagate happily.
 - Live cells with more than 3 neighbors die, as if by overpopulation.
 - Dead cells with exactly 3 neighbors come to life, as if by reproduction.
